The four optimal  paths above illustrate the shortest path found by ACO for the Travelling Salesman Problem. Here x and y axis are simply the coordinates of each point (blue dots) and the path is represented by the red line connecting the dots. The number of points shown in the graphs are 10, 50, 90 and 130 respectively from top left to bottom right.
